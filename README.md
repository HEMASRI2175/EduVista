## Team Contributions

### Member 1: [Your Name]

As the Backend Developer and Project Manager, I focused on designing and implementing RESTful APIs using Laravel, managing the MySQL database schema, and integrating secure user authentication with Laravel Passport. I also ensured seamless project execution by allocating tasks, conducting code reviews, and creating comprehensive documentation. Working with these technologies was a challenging yet rewarding experience, as it allowed me to enhance the application's performance and security while coordinating effectively with the team.

### Member 2: [Teammate's Name]

As the Frontend Developer, Middleware Developer, and UI/UX Designer, I was responsible for designing a responsive and intuitive user interface using Vue.js, developing reusable components, and managing application state with Vuex. I also integrated Axios for efficient communication with the backend APIs and developed custom middleware to handle frontend request validation and user activity tracking. Diving into these technologies was both exciting and enriching, as it enabled me to create a dynamic, secure, and engaging platform that meets users' needs.
